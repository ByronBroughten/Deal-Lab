// Make analysis be main.
// Is it possible to make Analyzer initialize from a sub-branch?
// In that case, it would have a "head" sectionName
// The head would have no parent, and only children
// would be allowable SectionNames
// And the head would be an "alwaysOne"

// I can flatten everything on the db and just use more dbSectionNames

// The rowIndex varb will be populated by the corresponding rowIndex on
// the clientSide. The rest will be populated by the current entry.
// It rowIndex on the clientSide could have a "rowInfo" subSection to guarantee
// no varb naming conflicts, and that subSection would be populated from the
// clientSide one. Ehhhh.
// Then I could add multiple "rowInfo" dbSections. propertyRowIndexInfo, etc.

// It would be nice to get rid of dbEntry[], and have just dbSections
// Each dbSections would need a head, though, right? With a dbId and sectionName
// to point to the head.
// Get would get the main section, then get its children, then get their
// children
// Delete would work in a simliar way.
// When deleting, you wouldn't have to remove from the parent. You could just
// update the parent when trying to access the child.
// You could also include the parentInfo on the child if it is not the head.

// Putting would be a little trickyâ€”you would have to compare the children and
// delete the ones that are no longer there
// You would need to use more dbSectionNames to avoid dbId conflicts. analysisProperty, etc

// lessons
// - derive union types from the Types that represent the very objects they will be indexing
// - refactoring from the inside-out is bce.
// - Don't use maps/objects if the values are ultimately ordered. Just put them
//   in an array rather than create a separate array with their ids that you'd
//   then have to query and keep synced.
// - It's great to compose state of class objects whose methods produce new objects
//   rather than mutate
// - Things seem easier if the property keys of like-objects are consistent
// - The more that you can maintain a single source of truth, the better. This means
//   producing values on the fly with functions rather than keeping them synced
// - Build in composable increments, like with the current molds, rather than with
//   big sweeping structures, like the old molds.
// - I made the decision to make sectionNames typesafe, and I think
//   that at this stage it was a mistake. Too much code must be refactored.
//   I didn't do it in a modular way.

// try using the portal for VarbAutoComplete and passing styles into it somehow.
// or figure out how to make it go up if there's not enough room down.

// Little silouiette of a house?
// Little robot mascot? Lol.
