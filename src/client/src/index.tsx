// I think I can implement the examples properly,
// and add a mode Toggle that for now just says "Buy and Hold"

//

// Options for how to spend this evening:
// 1. Work on a placeholder Wordpress site
// 2. Work on updating the UI
// 3. Work on adding the beginnings of the modes
// 4. Start gathering tax documentsâ€”maybe that's a Monday project
// 5. Implement the examples

// Consult branding, logo, and pro wordpress people
// https://bstro.com/

// UI Update
// 1. Make an un-itemized cost an option for singleTimeList
// 2. Do the same for ongoingList
// 3. Make a modal for editing itemized lists, which includes the
//    whole list menu
// 4. Start by displaying only the name and value of the cost list
//    and add an "edit" button
// 5. Think about making the cost list viewable

// 6. Add an example loan/mgmt/deal for loading and media
//    Make them usable for all deal modes

// Fix and flip notes:
// - Loans can be used to pay not only for the property
//   purchase price, but for the rehab costs, too.
//   That is, they can be a percentage of the rehab costs.

// - Closing costs are called purchase costs with fix and flip

// - Cost overrun is a property variableâ€”
//   add a certain percent to the rehab costs cause we always underestimate
//   It's kind of like the CapEx and maintenance budget

// BRRRR will involve both holding costs and ongoing costs
// - There can still be one purchase price, in
//   One Time Costs

// - Property taxes will play into both
// - Insurance will also play into both.
// - But it could be for two separate ratesâ€”one for holding costs, and one
//   for ongoing.

// - Ongoing costs

// - The comping is amazing

// - Holding costs has its own category, which is basically
//   "ongoing costs". Ongoing costs could be called holding costs.
//   Many of the property's basic information would be considered
//   holding costs
//   You would just change the title of Ongoing Costs to Holding Costs
//   Or you would add both and keep them separate

//   You might consider putting basic info like taxes and insurance
//   in the "Ongoing Costs" category
//   And you can put the purchase price in the upfront costs
//   category
//   That just leaves square feet as a miscellanious variable
//   You could also let the units be the bearers of sqft

// - One-Time costs would include both Purchase Costs (Loan closing costs)
// and Selling Costs (6% ARV, on the property).

//   It might not make sense to let properties function both as
//   buyAndHold and as

// Should the example sections contain each other?
// It might be easier if they don't.
// Then I don't have to worry as much about the Saved/unsaved
// changes status

// 2. Begin adding underpinnings of modes
// 4.
// -Give property the necessary vabs for buyAndHold and fixAndFlip
// -Give deal the necessary varbs for buyAndHold and fixAndFlip
// -Give deal an outputSection per mode
//  outputBuyAndHold
//  outputFixAndFlip
//  the varbs in those sections are things like, "showCocRoi", "showPitiPayments", etc.
//  They also have childSection virtualVarbs called "customOutputs"

// -Make sure it has a store for custom output lists, too

// -make the example property and deal work with all modes
// -add other modes: buyHoldSell, brrrr, and wholesale

// -Add the mode switch next to Deal
// -Make a property Component for each mode
// -Make an output component for each mode,
//  or make one that can be generalizable.

// 4. Make repairs, utilities, etc, be able to be singular values
//    that can switch to being itemizable.
//    When they are in itemize mode, a modal is summoned with a full,
//    spacious menu for editing the list and list items.

// 5. Make compareTable columns editable
// 6. Add info hover-ey thingies next to outputs and maybe some inputs

// If I'm going to make tables faster and increase functionality, here's how:
// I want the tables to reflect those
// - When creating the default user, initialize the tables
// - When creating a user, send the tables to the db
// - When logging in, load the saved table (and check it)
//   - remove extra rows
//   - add missing rows (to the front)
//   - update row information
// - When adding, updating, or deleting a section, adjust
//   the front-end table accordingly in real-time

// Extra stuff
// - In the load menu, highlight the one that is loaded with green or purple
// - Load rows according to whether autoSync is On
// - Implement column features

// Get beta users:
// 1. Post it on facebook/insta, asking for testers
// 2. Maybe try posting to facebook groups
// 3. Ask Ed to have a look at it
// 4. Maybe attend an RE meetup or two

// After Beta User attempt
// - Put Upgrade To Pro button back
// - Consult with a marketing agency
// - Make a video
// - Hire a marketing agency
// - Landing page with high SEO
// - Done with the app unless it makes any money

// Demo Link: https://youtu.be/81Ed3e54YS8

// 0. More efficient and better suited to the task than spreadsheets
// 1. Analyze properties faster
// 2. Be as precise as you prefer
// 3. Save and experiment with different combinations of loans and properties
// 4. Allow for custom inputs and outputs (still working on this)
// Right now it's in the beta testing stage. I'm looking for people to try it out, report bugs, and give any and all feedback, really. For beta, everything it can do is free. Most of what it can do will be free in the end.
// Here's a brief video demo:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGfb8xX2FsI
// Here's a link to the app: https://www.ultimatepropertyanalyzer.com/
// If you will try it and provide me with feedback, I would greatly appreciate it. ðŸ˜Š

// - Put userName (or first letter of email) on the right side where sign in/sign up were
// - When I change the displayName of a variable, I want that
// of its output to change, right?

// 2.5 Allow custom variables on property, loan, and mgmt (add guts, at least)
// - customVarb entityInfo updateFn updates the local value and gives an inEntity
//   to the varb it targets with source, "customVarb"
// - userVarbs check for entities with source "customVarb" and sums their values
// - customVarb editor is basicVarb editor with loaded displayName
// - is it possible to set editorLength based on title?
// - "Add Variable" button needed on basicInfo

// 3. Bring back custom outputs/output lists
// Analysis output list:
// Now I need a complex version of the menu

// Maybe give lists a "simple" and an "itemized" mode.
// This would require adding an additional value to the list.

// Maybe add an "Add Ongoing Costs" button to Management

// 5. Api variables
// 6. Sharing things with other users
// - Send a sharing invite to another user based on their email
// - If they accept, you can grant them readonly or edit access
//   to whatever they'd like
//   - This would obviously work best if I can get websockets going

// 1. When a subscription is active (or inactive), getUserData and updateSubscription
//    should return the subscription header like they're supposed to
//    - This will require parsing the json
//    - You will want to borrow from the stripe webhook

// Launch the app.
// - Post it, asking people for input
//   *Reddit
//    - r/realestateinvesting
//    - r/realestate
//    - r/landlords
//    - answer people's questions about how to size up properties
//    - Reddit ads
//   *Podcast ads
//    - Optimal finance daily
//   *Quora
//    - answer people's questions about how to analyze property
//   * Youtube ads
//   * Facebook ads
//    - banner
// - Post on the bigger pockets forum
// - Get an "influencer" to showcase it?

// - Think about the race condition on the front-end for someone starting
//   a subscription. This might not be a problem.
//   - The FE waits one second
//   - The FE sends the request to update its subscription
//   - the subscription is not yet thereâ€”there is no subscription
//     that was made recently, or no subscription that has never been
//     obtained by the front end

// - Maybe disable getUserData on the backend unless
//   the email has been verified

// Possible quick tutorials:
// Overview
// Analyze deals
// Reduce data entry
// - Reusing properties for different scenarios
// - Custom variables
// - Custom lists
// - api variables?
// Suit your needs
// - Custom variables
// - Custom outputs
// Compare deals

// Possible roadmap
// - Make roadmap
// - Network effect
//   - Link with other accounts
//   - Share variables, lists, properties, etc
//   - Forum, or a reddit thread or discord
//     This would be too much I think
