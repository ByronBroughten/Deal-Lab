// - Test the pro stuff in addSection.test
// - Test that addSection only accepts certain sectionNames
// - Run that same test in update/delete/get

// - Test the payment url route

// - Test the two Stripe webhooks.
//   - Create my own webhook events that simulate the ones stripe would send
//   - Use "generateTestHeaderString" to add a header that works

// - If the Jwt is expired in addSection, make it attempt to update the Jwt
// - Make it succeed if a valid subscription is present in the db
// - Make it fail if no such subscription exists in the db

// - Make a useEffect on the frontEnd that attempts to update the
//   front-end subscriptionInfo if the planExp is out of date

// - Load Deal with updated property, loan, and mgmt
//   - This is almost done. You just need a way to tell
//     it which dbStores to use
//   - You also need to create some kind of loop that says
//     which sections to use as a focal point next (parents down to children)

// rename "user" section to "userInfo", or "publicUserInfo"
// same with serverUserâ€”privateUserInfo, maybe

// - Add basic Google Analytics
// - Write a test to verify that the calculations work as expected
// - Think about what to do about the little "Show Details" bugs

// - Upload to Heroku
// - Make a video demo/ad
