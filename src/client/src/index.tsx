// Make the loadSectionList draw from the new displayName section
// When loading from the db, the sectionList must be correct.

// saving
// loading
// fn checks whether an activeSaved section should be created.

// on loading it also checks whether the old one
// should be deleted

// updating, update the activeSaved section

// copying
// removing
// creating new
// deleting
// fn checks whether any activeSaved sections should be deleted
// if it's the last section with that dbId, remove it from activeSaved

// Stayle - there are three relevant states of each savable unit
// 1. not saved - neutral border and shadow, word in the menu
// 2. saved - green border and shadow, word in the menu
// 3. unsaved changes - red border and shadow, word in the menu
// When people decide to load something, if they have unsaved changes,
// tell them which sections have those unsaved changes, and suggest that if they don't want to lose those changes, they can  save the updates or copy the section

// To the left of actions, add the icon
// The icon will look like the menu btns
// But it will be see-through and its colors will be like above

// You'll want to merge the simple list menu with the
// full one.
// You'll also want to merge the list menus with the
// main section menus

// ***Maybe put "Upgrade User to Pro" button back.
// ***Maybe make it possible to switch from numObj to stringObj
// ***Or just turn all numbers and strings to numObj and stringObj

// It turns out getting beta users will be difficult after all.
// You don't need the extra features for the below:
// 1. Post it on facebook/insta, asking for testers
// 2. Maybe try posting to facebook groups
// 3. Ask Ed to have a look at it
// 4. Maybe attend an RE meetup or two

I've been computer programming for awhile now, and after massively underestimating it, managed to make an app. Check it out, eh? And if you know anyone interested in rental property, I would love if they beta test it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGfb8xX2FsI
*/

// I'm making an app for analyzing rental property. These are the main goals:

// - Analyze properties faster and more precisely;
// - Experiment with different combinations of loans and properties
// - Save and reuse data

// 1. Analyze properties faster
// 2. Be as precise as you prefer
// 3. Save and experiment with different combinations of loans and properties
// 4. Allow for custom inputs and outputs (still working on this)
// Right now it's in the beta testing stage. I'm looking for people to try it out, report bugs, and give any and all feedback, really. For beta, everything it can do is free. Most of what it can do will be free in the end.
// Here's a brief video demo:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGfb8xX2FsI
// Here's a link to the app: https://www.ultimatepropertyanalyzer.com/
// If you will try it and provide me with feedback, I would greatly appreciate it. ðŸ˜Š

// - Get numObj editorText to display updated in-entity text. But also, it should keep
//   depreciated in-entity text. So it has to cache.

// - User solverSections in MainSection
// - "getUserData" sometimes returns 401 - unauthorized

// - Make main menu always present. Stylize buttons differently when user isn't logged in.
// - Put userName (or first letter of email) on the right side where sign in/sign up were

// Last steps to Ultimate Property Analyzer
// 1. User variables - make their entity displayName update.

// 2. Lists - add something that indicates whether list is saved or synced.
// Or remove this for now.

// make numObj and stringObj keys match

// When I change the displayName of a variable, I want that
// of its output to change, right?

// 2.5 Allow custom variables on property, loan, and mgmt (add guts, at least)
// - customVarb entityInfo updateFn updates the local value and gives an inEntity
//   to the varb it targets with source, "customVarb"
// - userVarbs check for entities with source "customVarb" and sums their values
// - customVarb editor is basicVarb editor with loaded displayName
// - is it possible to set editorLength based on title?
// - "Add Variable" button needed on basicInfo

// 3. Bring back custom outputs/output lists
// Analysis output list:
// Now I need a complex version of the menu

// Maybe give lists a "simple" and an "itemized" mode.
// This would require adding an additional value to the list.

// Maybe add an "Add Ongoing Costs" button to Management

// Basically, copy the menu from the property title menu
// edit that menu to handle full stores.

// 4. Bring back deal compare
// - Generate the table from the db every time
//    - implement property compare, etc
// Cherries on top
// 5. Api variables
// 6. Sharing things with other users
// - Send a sharing invite to another user based on their email
// - If they accept, you can grant them readonly or edit access
//   to whatever they'd like
//   - This would obviously work best if I can get websockets going

// 1. When a subscription is active (or inactive), getUserData and updateSubscription
//    should return the subscription header like they're supposed to
//    - This will require parsing the json
//    - You will want to borrow from the stripe webhook

// 2. Think about fixing the css register bug
// - A session is created after register but before email verification
// - Maybe I could use the post-email-verification feature that I could use
//   to create the new user

// Launch the app.
// - Post it, asking people for input
//   *Reddit
//    - r/realestateinvesting
//    - r/realestate
//    - r/landlords
//    - answer people's questions about how to size up properties
//    - Reddit ads
//   *Podcast ads
//    - Optimal finance daily
//   *Quora
//    - answer people's questions about how to analyze property
//   * Youtube ads
//   * Facebook ads
//    - banner
// - Post on the bigger pockets forum
// - Get an "influencer" to showcase it?

// - Think about the race condition on the front-end for someone starting
//   a subscription. This might not be a problem.
//   - The FE waits one second
//   - The FE sends the request to update its subscription
//   - the subscription is not yet thereâ€”there is no subscription
//     that was made recently, or no subscription that has never been
//     obtained by the front end

// - Maybe implement social login
// - Maybe disable getUserData on the backend unless
//   the email has been verified

// - Do I want to use the same variable names for the dropdown as I do for the ones in the equations? Yes, I think I do. At least for display purposes.
// - Ah, but that wouldn't differentiate userVarb sections.
// - I would need a way to differentiate those, too.
// 1. Perhaps it can optionally show the sectionName in bold above the entity.
//    If the sectionName is too long, though, that doesn't work
// 2. Optionally add the sectionName to the front of the variable.
//    This is an ok solution. Perhaps if you click the entity it does this.
// 3. Add a small menu to the entities. It shows the sectionName, and some options

// Possible quick tutorials:
// Overview
// Analyze deals
// Reduce data entry
// - Reusing properties for different scenarios
// - Custom variables
// - Custom lists
// - api variables?
// Suit your needs
// - Custom variables
// - Custom outputs
// Compare deals

// Possible roadmap
// - Roadmap
// - Custom variables
// - Custom lists
// - Network effect
//   - Link with other accounts
//   - Share variables, lists, properties, etc
//   - Forum, or a reddit thread or discord
//     This would be too much I think

// It would be good to break up theme
// themeBtn.ts
// theme.btn.
// etc.

// You probably want example lists and variables.

// Be more like Googleâ€”put the menu on the left side.
// I could make the lists be "advanced"
