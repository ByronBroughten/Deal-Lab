No long-term analysis of a property is complete without accounting for these inevitable costs.\n\nA common (and easy) method to account for these is to assume that all the CapEx costs together will average to about 5% of the property's rental income.\n\nA more precise method is to go through each major capital expense and estimate both how much it would cost to replace it and how many years the replacements will last. From there, the app will calculate how much you should budget per month for each capital expense as well as their total.`,

// Ok, first I need a checkbox component that can take anything that has
// "isActive: boolean".

// That's going to be its own thing in the itemsComponent.
// The itemsComponent will have "VarbListCapEx", but it will be
// "CapExCustomList"

// That component displays the names in rows.
// Not sure how I'm going to flex them, though. Might just make it flex how it will
// and tailor the widths to the checkbox container.
// I'll need a checkbox container.
// Then I simply loop through the ongoingCheckboxItem childNames, and if
// "isActive" is false, I display them as an option in the checkmark box

// Then I need another item for when they're checked
// It's a tableRow, or collection of cells
// That item will have the checkbox on the left, next to the displayName
// Then it will have the typical capEx cells
