export const capExDescription = `Capital Expenses, or CapEx, are those big, expensive things every property has that will eventually need to be replacedâ€”things like the roof, furnace, and water heater. No long-term analysis of a property is complete without accounting for these inevitable costs.\n\nA common (and easy) method to account for these is to assume that all the CapEx costs together will average to about 5% of the property's rental income.\n\nA more precise method is to go through each major capital expense and estimate both how much it would cost to replace it and how many years the replacements will last. From there, the app will calculate how much you should budget per month for each capital expense as well as their total.`;

export const capExItemizeDescription = `Itemizing CapEx is pretty easy, and it can be more accurate using a general rule of thumb like the 5% rent rule.\n\nFor each major capital expense item a property has, simply enter an estimate of the cost to replace that item and an estimate of how long the replacement would likely last. The app will calculate the rest.`;
