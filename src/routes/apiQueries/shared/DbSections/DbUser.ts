  // I'm close, but there are some problems with how I'm saving things.

  // Having the properties in one place with the tables keeping
  // track of them
  // That means I must update the properties in two places

  // still, using a name like "sectionIndex" complicates matters

  // one other option is to have a container called, "mainPropertyStore"
  // its children would be the properties.

  // I would have to create new query functions, though, which I don't like.

  // I want to be able to use a store name, like propertyTableStore
  // and then use its child type, like table.
  // so propertyTableStore only contains one table
  // mainPropertyStore contains properties

  // a possible idea is to make a section called stores: {
  // propertyTableStore: { table }
  // mainPropertyStore: { property }
  // }
  // Then the db has corresponding sectionNames
  // that makes saving trickier, though.

  // The advantage of the other way, with the table synced with proerties
  // is that both the table and other things can reference the same properties
  // It's just that the properties don't mean anything if they're
  // not being referenced.
  // Maybe that's the key. For each section not referenced, it's deleted.
  // If something is saved, on the other hand, that references something
  // Hmm, no. This is weird.

  // Ok. I think I figured it out.

  // I know that if I were to keep all the properties etc in-memory,
  // there is a high liklihood that I wouldn't be able to store all that state
  // in local storage.

  // the tables contain that state
  // combine "addSection" and "updateSection"
  // when saving a property, save the property first, then save the table.
  // (or both simultaneously)
  // if the table fails to save, then the property isn't really saved
  // for not-full sections, the table is the source of truth.
  // then if a property isn't in a table but it somehow exists in the db
  // delete it.
  // if a property is in the table but doesn't exist in the db, something
  // went terribly wrong.

  // I forsee a future situation in which for some reason I have a second property store
  // That one might have full properties, like "defaultProperty"
  // if I still had "defaultProperty", it could still save in property, but it would
  // have its own dbId

  // The problem is that names and sectionTypes are intertwined.
  // Can I just have dbStores that have different names, but each of which
  // is assigned a type?
  // I could perform operations to and from different dbStores, and I would map the
  // sectionType to each one.
  // the dbStoreNames wouldn't necessarily have to be sectionNames. I like that.
  // just make dbStoreNames not have to be sectionNames (but they can be).
  // mainPropertyStore would have properties
  // but then when I load a deal, its more complicated to update its properties.
  // It would have to know to check, "mainPropertyStore". It would have to know
  // that "mainPropertyStore" is one of the stores to check for that kind
  // of thing and that what it stores is properties. Seems complicated.
