### Ultimate Deal Analyzer Server

[Live Test Website](https://ultimate-property-analyzer.herokuapp.com/).

## Description:

This is the server side of a fullstack application. It uses Typescript with Node.js, Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB.

The server carries out CRUD operations between the client and the database; it produces and validates JSON web tokens to safeguard user-specific operations; it validates incoming data before saving to the database.

For a more complete description of the full application's function (most of which is carried out on the client side), see here: https://github.com/ByronBroughten/Property-Analyzer-Client-Side
